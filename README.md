# EECS475-Machine_Learning_Foundation_Application_Algorithm
A machine Learning course taking in Northwestern University during my master degree study. I will update it weekly since my homework will
be annouanced everyweek.

## Assignment 1 
Assignment 1 is related to Linear Regression and Linear two-class classification. You can refer to the [Professor Jeremy Watt's website](https://jermwatt.github.io/mlrefined/index.html) and find detailed course material about these two topics and other topics which will be taught in the class later.
